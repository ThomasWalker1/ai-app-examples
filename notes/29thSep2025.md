## Agenda

1. Brainstorm and choose a project idea
2. Schedule an OASUS observation

## Notes

### Project Idea 

- Use a conversational turn-based problem solving laboratory to deduce a students' learning factors (prior knowledge, affect, etc.)
- Create a diagnostic summary of the game turns to inform the tutor's pedagogic strategy

### Desired Outcomes

1. Students can practice engaging with conceptual problem solving
2. Tutors can understand students' learning factors and better adjust the PAL session in response

## Comments

### OASUS Observation

- PHYS 101 @ Oct 6, 4 PM

### Things to try

- Is an LLM able to function as a "game master"?
- Can an LLM generate a procedure the student must follow to reach a given game goal?
    - How to make procedures with varying difficulties?
    - How to create procedures that are not only solvable, but pedagogically informative (i.e., reveal hidden learning factors)?
