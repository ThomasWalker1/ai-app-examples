## Agenda

1. OASUS observation (PHYS 101)

## Notes

### OASUS Observation

- The PAL model for PHYS 101 is a guided problem solving session:
    1. The facilitator displays a physics problem
    2. The student attempts to work the problem out on the whiteboard, explaining their thought processes to the facilitator
- Only 1 student attended the PAL session we observed
    - Remark: Since the facilitator's attention was not divided, the student received maximal guidance
    - Question: How would this session look with 5 students? 15 students?
- Note: The facilitator doesn't know *exactly* what was covered in lecture, but has a general week-by-week idea of what was/will be discussed
- If the session ends early, students can ask the facilitator specific questions
- Idea: If we know students' prior knowledge (i.e., misconceptions) before the session, we can strategically group them to optimize the facilitator's strategy 
    - Scenario I: The students are grouped to cover each others misconceptions (encouraging co-regulation), and the facilitator primarily provides high-level interventions 
    - Scenario II: The students are grouped by misconception, so the facilitator's interventions can be more economic (i.e., reducing the number of times misconception X has to be corrected)
- Idea: Have an LLM be a Socratic questioner ("What if..." on repeat)
