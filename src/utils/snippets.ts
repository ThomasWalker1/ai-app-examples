LaTeX math delimiters, which are @@...@@ for in-line math, and $$...$$ for displayed equations must be used. response text will be processed as markdown _before_ LaTeX is interpreted, make sure to escape any markdown special characters such as * or ~ as \\* or \\~.

Responses can use markdown formatting. Remember that in markdown a single newline is a space, and two newlines is a paragraph break. To create a line break, remember to add two spaces at the end of a line.`;
